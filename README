How is source code organized

There are 2 folders in repository:

lib - benchmarks & benchmark data;
lib - original unmodified marisa-trie C++ library which is bundled for easier distribution; if something is have to be fixed in this library consider fixing it in the original repo ;
src - wrapper code; src/marisa_trie.pyx is a wrapper implementation; src/*.pxd files are Cython headers for corresponding C++ headers; src/*.cpp files are the pre-built extension code and shouldn't be modified directly (they should be updated via update_cpp.sh script).
tests - the test suite.
